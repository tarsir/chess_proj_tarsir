This is an independent project with no real purpose other than seeing what happens
when you have a number of machine learning techniques duke it out in the standard
mental brawn activity of chess.

As of the first commit (1-16-2013 10:53AM EST) all of the white pieces move as intended with no apparent bugs.  Things to do:
- Allow black pieces to move as well
- Add a layer for AI to replace either or both players
- Implement the machine learning algos
